**Does it sound like it's recorded in a single take bathroom recording session? Good, that's because it was.**
\
\
\
I may actually like this one. Maybe because, unlike most of the other songs, this one kinda a coherent structure to it. And some fairly memorable melody lines. 
\
\
(Maybe I should have made it longer. Oh well.)
\
\
Or maybe it's because my friend's laying down some really good strumming stuff in the back. That's right, first time I've had someone else play for one of these, and wow did it save me so much time. Remind me to do more songs with friends, hmm?
\
\
**Instruments used:** Guitar. A friend, and another guitar. Garageband piano \*sigh\*.
