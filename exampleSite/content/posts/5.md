**In which I layer 3 guitar parts without causing nausea. Yay.**
\
\
\
I had this idea, see? Of a song with pretty violin music. With a guitar just chilling in the back. It sounded so good in my head.
\
\
Except. My violin is old. And scratchy. What he really wants is to lay down and die. And so all I could do was force a few stabbing screeches put of him near the end.
\
\
And as much as I'd like to write a violin song, I'm told a new one costs ~$300 dollars. (Crowdfunding, anyone?) So instead you get this. 
\
\
**Instruments used:** Guitar, Garageband piano (i hate it so much), Garageband bass, (a tiny bit of) violin.
