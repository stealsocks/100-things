\
**sometimes you have to make things just for the sake of making.**
\
\
\
I think I deleted ~1 hour worth of takes from a previous song idea before I decided to make this one. 
If this teaches me anything, it will be how to kill ideas that deserve to die. 
\
\
So this is a tune that I put out just so I wouldn't spend weeks stuck in a rut. When something is this bad, 
I can feel better about everything that comes after it.
\
\
**Instruments used:** guitar. garageband piano.
