For example, the bgcolor property sets the background colour for your whole site. 

You can change it to any of the regular CSS values. e.g.
bgcolor = "black"
bgcolor = "#FFFFFF"
bgcolor = "rgb(255, 255, 255)"

"Special boxes" refer to blocks that have their "special" property set to "true" in the items.toml file. They are therefore suppsoed to have seperate style properties than regular blocks.
